# Launch Modes
There are five types of launch modes:

Standard
Single top
Single task
Single instance
Single instance per task

1. Standard
When you don't specify any launch mode, standard is the default one. It creates a new instance of the activity every time you start it. Suppose A, B, C, D, etc. are activities. It works as follows:
The task with activities:
# A -> B -> C

2. Single top
If an activity is at the top of the task and you create its instance again, then a new instance will not be created. Instead onNewIntent() will be called with updated data. If activity is not on top, a new instance will be pushed. See with examples:
The task with activities:
# A -> B -> C -> D
-> Launch activity B. As B is not on top, a new instance will be created:
   A -> B -> C -> B
-> Launch activity B again. As B is on top, onNewIntent() on B will be called:
   A -> B -> C -> B

3. Single task
If the activity doesn't exist in the task, a new instance is created otherwise onNewIntent() is called. Additionally, activities above it get destroyed. Let's understand this with examples:
The task with activities:
A -> B -> C
->Start activity B with launch mode single task:
  A -> B-> C-> B
Now you can see that B is already there. So a new instance is not created. The onNewIntent() of B is called. Also, C were destroyed.

4. Single instance
For an activity that has a single instance launch mode, a new task is created. First, see the example, then we can explain it.

The task with activities:
A -> B -> C
-> Launch B with launch mode single instance:
   Task-1: A -> C -> D
   Task-2: B
-> If you launch B again, it will not create a new task. In the same instance of B, the onNewIntent() method will be called.

5. Single instance per task




# Note: Launch mode can be set from AndroidManifest.xml like this:
<activity android:name=”.MainActivity”
          android:launchMode=”singleTop” />

- > Or Java/Kotlin code using flags like this:
val intent = Intent(activity, HomeGenericActivity::class.java).apply { addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_SINGLE_TOP) }
